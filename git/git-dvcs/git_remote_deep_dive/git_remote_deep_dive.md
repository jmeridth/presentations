# Remote Branches #

### "Remote branches are references to the state of branches on your remote repositories. They\'re local branches that you can\'t move. They\'re moved automatically whenever you do any network communication. Remote branches act as bookmarks to remind you where the branches on your remote repositories were the last time you connected to them... They take the form (remote)/(branch)" Chapter 3 sect. 5 Pro Git Book ###
